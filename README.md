The project started in 2021, I wanted to install this unique piece of equipment onto my ecto, Ecto XV, after some time of looking at options I decided to make my own. this was made using many photos available online of the original ecto 1's roof rack and sketches that were available in the Ghostbusters Hanes service manual. I attempted to reach out to Texas Instruments and later Raytheon (current owners of the TI Aerospace division) to try and find more accurate mechanical drawings of this device with no luck. therfore i cant guarentee this is 100% accurate due to my limited resources. this is still a WIP as i have yet to build this version of the cross sectional and cant guarentee perfect fit up. two versions of the plate are in these files. one is a flat plate like what my prototypes were like, and one that has bent tabs like what the original unit had. the bent tabs add difficulty in the manufacturing process so only specific outfits like Oshcut who offer sheet metal bending can make this. obvioulsy the bent faceplate is more expensive but the flat one is still available.(STLs have also been made available, they just arnt entry level printer friendly)

The decals that were used are from fannstar with custom cut dataplate and dial decals. Contact the shop prior to ordering and request "the Oval Data plate scaled to 1 5/8 wide & a 7mm round center hole cut out of the dial decals"
